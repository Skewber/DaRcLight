The goal of **DaRcLight** (**Da**ta **R**edu**c**tion and ana**L**ysi of L**ight**) is to provide a set of tools to streamline and automate the data reduction process of astronomical data. The code is initially developed for the vienna little telescope (vlt) at the institute for astronomy in vienna but should e working with diferent data sets as well.

The code is still under development and will certainly break at certain points so please be pacient.
